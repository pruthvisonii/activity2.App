This Git repository, "AppliedActivity2," contains an application built on Maui .NET for retrieving Canadian holidays from a public API. The app features a consistent UI using styles, flyout navigation, and stack layouts. It utilizes MVVM architecture and implements services and interfaces. Users can retrieve holidays for multiple years, filter by year and province, and earn bonus marks for filtering by both.
